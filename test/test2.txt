Don't Want to Fall

Back at home

Why should I try? When I know you'll choose another guy
You a lie, on your fifth and probably switchin' sides
With a guy, that ain't gon' do shit for you but apply
For that nine to five, and you satisfied, why?
Hi, I'm that nigga that you won't forget, such a threat
See me up and now she wanna text
LAX, I just landed, I left all my friends
Back at home, feel alone

Making love, said she want my trust and that she ain't get enough (what?)
You ain't gettin' none, bitch
I said we done, this shit not fun
And I'm not the one to be messin' with
I'm not the one you been flexin' with
I'm not the one, that's the end of it
Ain't no questioning
If I do, where was you
There's no end of it
You were heaven-sent, a lesson that I'm dealing with

Oh-oh oh, you can't stop me
Oh-oh oh, heart so broken
Oh-oh oh, you can't fix it
Oh-oh oh, I been missing

Why should I try? When I know you'll choose another guy
You a lie, on your fifth and probably switchin' sides
With a guy, that ain't gon' do shit for you but apply
For that nine to five, and you satisfied, why?
Hi, I'm that nigga that you won't forget, such a threat
See me up and now she wanna text
LAX, I just landed, I left all my friends
Back at home, feel alone
