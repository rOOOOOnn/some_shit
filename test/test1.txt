18

I was only 18, when she told me that she hate me
Don't give a f*ck about love, too mainstream
Baby, is you tryna drive me crazy?
Don't wanna push you to the edge but you make me
I was only 18, when she told me that she hate me
Don't give a f*ck about love, too mainstream
Baby, is you tryna drive me crazy?
Don't wanna push you to the edge but you make me

You make me lose my mind
Knew I should've left you behind
You make me lose my mind
Knew I should've left you behind
When you say it's over (when it's over)
I'll never be sober (be sober)
When you say it's over (it's over)
I'll never be sober

Please tell me why, I fall for your kind
So easily girl
Quit teasin' me girl
You said that things gon' change, but
You stayed the same and it's dangerous, so dangerous
